(From IRB) Classroom participants will be paid $25 through an Amazon e-code sent to their email at the end of the study (semester).

We are looking at ~234 participants for initial data collection

Possible process for students:
- some type of pitch for students to be interested
	- email
	- in-person speech

Student ID Matching:
1. While obtaining consent through an online form, we ask for the netID and match it to a participant ID
2. We then keep a list of participant IDs
3. Provide a matching of participant IDs to netIDs for the instructor

***Nigel meeting notes***
What did we say we would compensate the students.
Process for students to enroll: 
	-pitch research to students/could be email to the students
	 -number of participants we are interested in. setup plugin as part of consent process
	 -how PID to student ID mapping process will work
		 -what is convenient
		 -need to know netIDS to pay participant/consent but don't need mapping
		 -could have them enter netid (as participant id) on one page
			 -then generate an expected ID (there is)
				 -save that log file
			-make request from GO server to generate ID
			-fetch from client side rather than server side
				 -log only in that log file and separate columns and randomly shuffle for our purposed
			-as filling out survey data is sent from the extension to see if
