We can turn the current research into a "where can unfairness mitigation fail for educational data" paper.

We would need specific examples of how the unfairness mitigation strategy impacted data and led to some type of fairer model, but an implication seems wrong because of this.

Make sure we could extend papers. PPR vs Accuracy. Could find that the fairness definitions are incompatible in education.

Explore the tradeoff in education research

Could say how big is the tradeoff/gap and given the average gap between the accuracy/base rates could simulate a what-if the benefit of predicting mastery is X amount relative to the benefit of predicting accuracy.

- Assumptions of definitions might not work for educational data
	- I think metrics assume that a fair distribution exists due to us having equal initial base rates
- Outcomes are inequivalent
